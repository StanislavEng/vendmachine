Used to repractice C++ programming

Have not worked in C++ (or any programming outside of embedded) environments in a while. 
This project is meant to create a simple program that can be developed to be more encompassing
the most useful features of C++, from structs to classes, to pointers, etc.

Roadmap:

Stage 1:
The original program, using one .cpp file with structures only.

Stage 2:
Converting to Classes

Stage 3:
TBD
